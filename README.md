# Convolutional-Neural-Network
◦ Trained a VGG19-based deep neural network (SportVGG) on a 100-class sports image dataset, achieving
86.4% test accuracy using a two-stage fine-tuning approach with Grad-CAM interpretability.

◦ Designed and optimized a U-Net model for semantic segmentation of horse images (Weizmann dataset),
achieving a best IoU of 0.8023 with experiments on Dice, BCE, and Focal losses.

◦ Implemented Seg-Grad-CAM to visualize feature importance across U-Net decoder stages, offering detailed
insight into model attention and decision pathways.
